          <h1>What is Wi-Chai?</h1>

<h3>Ever encountered the problem of wanting to work from a coffee-shop on a rainy sunday?</h3>

<p>Remember the experience you had, when you just stumbled in the first one you saw, all soaking wet:
Loud music, bad coffee, your laptops battery is starving but there is no free plug and worst of all the wifi tubes are clogged!</p>

<p>If you nodded in agreement, don't you worry no more,
cause Wi-Chai's got your back!</p>

<p>We'll find you the best coffee-shop based on the three aforementioned categories:
Atmosphere | Wifi | Power </p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<p>'How do I find the best coffee shop?' I hear you scream in deafening silence, well let me tell you.</p>

<p>Based on your current location or on a user defined location we'll find coffee-shops around you.</p>

<p>These will be sorted by their wifi quality, their power socket amount and finally their overall working environment (is it noisy? is there enough room, etc).</p>

<p>The overall score is represented in what we call Chai-Score - an aggregated overall score based on the individual categories.</p>

<h1>This coffee-shops was great / horrible how can I let others know about this?</h1>

<p>Easy peasy! Rate the shop!
You can rate every category in a range between 1-5.
Once you're done, your score will be added to the shops overall score for everyone else to see.</p>

<p>Cheers
The Wi-Chai Team</p>
