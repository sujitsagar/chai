I hear you scream in deafening silence, well let me tell you.\r\n\r\nBased on your current location or on a user defined location we'll find coffee-shops around you.\r\n\r\nThese will be sorted by their wifi quality, their power socket amount and finally their overall working environment (is it noisy? is there enough room, etc).\r\n\r\nThe overall score is represented in what we call Chai-Score - an aggregated overall score based on the individual categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n# This coffee-shops was great / horrible how can I let others know about this?\r\n\r\nEasy peasy! Rate the shop!\r\nYou can rate every category in a range between 1-5.\r\nOnce you're done, your score will be added to the shops overall score for everyone else to see.\r\n\r\n\r\nWi-Chai can be used here: [Wi-Chai](www.wi-chai.com)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nThe Wi-Chai Team\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
